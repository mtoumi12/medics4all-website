## ABOUT SECTION
**Title**: The Global Healthcare Language Crisis

**Problem Statement**:
Healthcare providers worldwide face a critical challenge: 25M+ US patients and billions globally can't effectively communicate with their doctors due to language barriers. This leads to medical errors, poor outcomes, and massive compliance costs.

**Key Statistics**:
• $2.1 billion addressable market for multilingual medical documentation
• Doctors spend 40% of their time switching between languages and translation apps
• Current interpreter solutions cost $100-300 per session
• 95% of medical AI tools fail on African and Arabic accents

**Feature 3: Multi-Dialect Support**
Optimized for Arabic, African dialects, and underserved languages that Google Translate can't handle accurately in medical contexts.

Built-in CBAHI, JCI, and HIPAA compliance. Meets legal requirements for multilingual healthcare documentation.
